Next time you need to install something with python setup.py -- which should be never but things happen. 
```
python setup.py install --record files.txt
```

This will cause all the installed files to be printed to that directory.
Then when you want to uninstall it simply run; be careful with the 'sudo'
```
cat files.txt | xargs sudo rm -rf
```
